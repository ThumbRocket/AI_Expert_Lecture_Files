Share Email Print Feedback Background The location of the base of tongue malignancy is critical in the diagnosis, management, and prognosis. The base of tongue is the site for the posterior opening of the oral cavity, the entrance of the pharynx and esophagus, and the inferior aspect of the nasopharynx . The surgical management of malignant neoplasms of the tongue base remains difficult despite recent advances in diagnostic techniques. Many patients present at an older age with advanced disease because of the occult nature of associated symptoms. The disease process and treatment often affect adjacent structures, such as the posterior floor of the mouth, larynx, and esophagus. Careful multidisciplinary assessment and treatment selection based on the probability of cure and preservation of function are of paramount importance in the treatment of these patients. High recurrence rates, poor survival, and significant alterations in speech and swallowing function are common experiences for patients with malignancies in these anatomic sites. Despite these frustrations, patients are potentially curable and should be offered regimens that carefully consider morbidity and outcome within the context of the patient's overall medical condition. Etiology Chronic alcohol and prolonged tobacco use, older age, geographic location, and family history are important risk factors for development of base of the tongue carcinoma. Environmental exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos, and welding fumes may increase the risk of pharyngeal cancer. Nutritional deficiencies and infectious agents (especially papillomavirus and fungi) may also play a significant role. For example, a Danish study, by Garnaes et al, attributed a rise in eastern Denmark in the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the base of the tongue between 2000 and 2010 (by 5.4% per year) to an increase in the number of such tumors (by 8.1% per year) that were positive for human papillomavirus. [ 1]Pathophysiology The tongue is vital organ that plays a critical role in speech and swallowing. During the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, food and liquid are propelled toward the oropharynx from the oral cavity by the tongue and muscles of mastication. The larynx is elevated, effectively compressing the epiglottis and supraglottic larynx against the base of the tongue and forcing food, liquid, and saliva into the hypopharynx and cervical esophagus. The anatomic location of the hypoglossal nerve within the base of the tongue puts it at risk from invasion or compression from malignant neoplasms at the primary site or metastatic disease in the neck. The tongue plays another important function in speech along with larynx and pharynx, which are the primary organs that shape sound into intelligible speech. Any alteration in tongue and pharynx mobility is immediately recognized as altered speech. Any loss of tissue from the base of tongue area prevents a watertight closure with the larynx during the act of swallowing. This mismatch allows food and liquid to escape into the pharynx and larynx, altering the carefully choreographed swallowing reflex and often resulting in aspiration. Both neurologic impairment and alteration in the coordinated act of swallowing from malignancies in this area can have devastating affects on speech and swallowing ability. Presentation Dysphagia, odynophagia, sensation of a mass in the throat, or the presence of a mass in the neck are the most common clinical manifestations of the base of the tongue carcinoma. Patients also may complain of referred ear pain or hemoptysis. Delay in diagnosis is not uncommon because of the common and sometimes vague nature of symptoms and the relative inaccessibility of the base of the tongue to examination. Upon physical examination, a mass is usually palpable in this area. Extensive submucosal disease or a strong gag reflex may make palpation more difficult. Patients may have bilateral palpable adenopathy because of the midline location and the high propensity for regional lymph node metastases. Indirect or flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy in the office is a useful adjunct to the physical examination. Relevant Anatomy The base of the tongue is a subsite within the oropharynx and is bounded anterosuperiorly by the circumvallate papilla and the posterior aspect of the oral cavity, inferoposteriorly by the vallecula and lingual surface of epiglottis, and laterally by the glossoepiglottic folds. Tongue development begins in the floor of the primitive oral cavity along with thyroid gland during the fourth embryonic week and develops from the region of the first 3-4 branchial arches. If the thyroid gland fails to migrate to the neck, it will result as a lingual thyroid. The tongue is eventually supplied by the lingual arteries and has complex capillary and venous systems. Innervation of the tongue includes the lingual and hypoglossal nerves for sensation and movement and the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and special sensory fibers for salivation and taste ability. Tongue musculature includes both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles that contribute to the varied and subtle movements involved in speech and swallowing. Because the mucosa of the base of the tongue contains squamous epithelium, minor salivary glands, and lymphoid tissue, malignant neoplasms may arise from these tissues. Contraindications Surgical excision and other modalities of treatment for the malignant base of the tongue tumors are based on the patient's comorbidities and his or her ability to tolerate surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. An obvious contraindication is patient refusal. Of primary consideration is the patient's ability to tolerate some degree of aspiration as a consequence of treatment. Underlying lung disease must be carefully assessed prior to surgery. Informed consent must be obtained prior to surgical intervention. Additionally, tumors may be considered inoperable because of their size (ie, extent) or location. As is true with other sites of the head and neck, early-stage mucosal squamous cell carcinomas of the base of tongue can be treated adequately with radiotherapy or surgical resection. Chemoradiation has been advocated because of the morbidity associated with extensive surgical resection. Recent advances in surgical techniques, including endoscopic/video-assisted resection and vascular tissue grafts, have decreased the morbidity historically associated with tongue base surgery.

Species See List of Quercus species An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus ( / \\u02c8 k w \\u025c\\u02d0r k \\u0259 s /; [1] Latin \\\"oak tree\\\") of the beech family, Fagaceae. There are approximately 600 extant species of oaks. The common name \\\"oak\\\" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species. [2]Oaks have spirally arranged leaves, with lobate margins in many species; some have serrated leaves or entire leaves with smooth margins. Many deciduous species are marcescent, not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of catkins) and small female flowers. [3] The fruit is a nut called an acorn or oak nut borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule; each acorn contains one seed (rarely two or three) and takes 6\\u201318 months to mature, depending on their species. The acorns and leaves contain tannic acid, [4] which helps to guard from fungi and insects. [5] The live oaks are distinguished for being evergreen, but are not actually a distinct group and instead are dispersed across the genus.

Oaks may be divided into two genera (sometimes referred to as subgenera) and a number of sections: Genus Quercus Oak at Sch\\u00f6nderling See also: List of Quercus species The genus Quercus is divided into the following sections: Sect. Quercus (synonyms Lepidobalanus and Leucobalanus ), the white oaks of Europe, Asia and North America. Styles are short; acorns mature in 6 months and taste sweet or slightly bitter; the inside of an acorn shell is hairless. The leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips, which are usually rounded. The type species is Quercus robur. Sect. Mesobalanus, Hungarian oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles long; acorns mature in about 6 months and taste bitter; the inside of this acorn's shell is hairless. The section Mesobalanus is closely related to section Quercus and sometimes included in it. Sect. Cerris, the Turkey oak and its relatives of Europe and Asia. Styles long; acorn mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn's shell is hairless. Its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip. Sect. Protobalanus, the canyon live oak and its relatives, in southwest United States and northwest Mexico. Styles short, acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. Leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip. Sect. Lobatae (synonym Erythrobalanus ), the red oaks of North America, Central America and northern South America. Styles long; acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The actual nut is encased in a thin, clinging, papery skin. Leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe. Genus Cyclobalanopsis Old oak tree on the shore of Lake Koluvere, Estonia. The ring-cupped oaks of eastern and southeastern Asia. Evergreen trees growing 10\\u201340 m (33\\u2013131 ft) tall. They are distinct from subgenus Quercus in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. IUCN, ITIS, Encyclopedia of Life and Flora of China treats Cyclobalanopsis as a distinct genus, but some taxonomists consider it a subgenus of Quercus. It contains about 150 species. Species of Cyclobalanopsis are common in the evergreen subtropical laurel forests which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of genus Castanopsis and the laurel family ( Lauraceae ). Hybridization A hybrid white oak, possibly Quercus stellata \\u00d7 Q. muhlenbergii Interspecific hybridization is quite common among oaks but usually between species within the same section only and most common in the white oak group (subgenus Quercus, section Quercus; see List of Quercus species ). Inter-section hybrids, except between species of sections Quercus and Mesobalanus, are unknown. Recent systematic studies appear to confirm a high tendency of Quercus species to hybridize because of a combination of factors. White oaks are unable to discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are wind pollinated and they have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring. [6] Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species. [6] [7]Frequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with copious amounts of introgression, and the evolution of new species. [8] Frequent hybridization and high levels of introgression have caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information. [9] Having high rates of hybridization and introgression produces genetic data that often does not differentiate between two clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations. [10] Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how oak species are able to remain morphologically and ecologically distinct with such high levels of gene flow, but the phenomenon is still largely a mystery to botanists. The Fagaceae, or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a very slow evolving clade compared to other angiosperms, [11] [12] and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in Quercus pose a great challenge to the concept of a species since a species is often defined as a group of \\u201cactually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\\u201d [13] By this definition, many species of Quercus would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and, to a large extent, genetic data. Uses Heart of oak beams of the frame of Saint-Girons church in Monein, France Oak wood has a density of about 0.75 g / cm 3 (0.43 oz/cu in) creating great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high tannin content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when quartersawn. Oak planking was common on high status Viking longships in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the Middle Ages for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the House of Commons in London and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from Quercus robur and Quercus petraea, was used in Europe for the construction of ships, especially naval men of war, [14] until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European timber-framed buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for furniture making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production. Barrels in which wines, sherry, and spirits such as brandy, Irish whiskey, Scotch whisky and Bourbon whiskey are aged are made from European and American oak, with single barrel whiskey fetching a premium. The use of oak in wine can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky vanillin flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks ( Quercus robur, Q. petraea) give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for smoking fish, meat, cheeses, [15] and other foods. Sherry maturing in oak barrels Japanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer Yamaha Drums. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as maple and birch. In hill states of India, besides fuelwood and timber, the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements. The leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock. [16] [17]A cross section of the trunk of a cork oak, Quercus suber The bark of the cork oak is used to produce winestoppers (corks). This species grows in the Mediterranean Sea region, with Portugal, Spain, Algeria, and Morocco producing most of the world's supply. Of the North American oaks, the northern red oak is one of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevents them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10 inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. Shumard oak, a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as \\\"mechanically superior\\\" to northern red oak. Cherrybark oak is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber. The standard for the lumber of the white oak group \\u2013 all of which is marketed as white oak \\u2013 is the Quercus alba. White oak is often used to make wine barrels. The wood of the deciduous pedunculate oak and sessile oak accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as Holm oak and cork oak also produce valuable timber. The bark of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations. Oak bark is also rich in tannin, and is used by tanners for tanning leather. Acorns are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee. Oak forest in Estonia. Oak on sandy earth. Oak forest on the beach in Njivice, Croatia Oak galls were used for centuries as a main ingredient in iron gall ink, a kind of manuscript ink, harvested at a specific time of year. [ citation needed] In Korea, oak bark is used to make shingles for traditional roof construction. Biodiversity and ecology Oaks are keystone species in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. For example, oak trees are important components of hardwood forests, and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the Ericaceae in oak-heath forests. [18] [19] A number of kinds of truffles, including the two well known varieties, the black P\\u00e9rigord truffle [20] and the white Piedmont truffle, [21] have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. The European pied flycatcher is an example of an animal species that often depends upon oak trees. Many species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild, largely due to land use changes, livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting. For example, over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood and charcoal. [22] In the USA, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known, but thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests. [23] In a recent survey, 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction, from a global total of over 500 species. [24] The proportion under threat may be much higher in reality, as there is insufficient information about over 300 species, making it near impossible to form any judgement of their status. In the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine forests due to the increase in temperature. The associated species of pine forest may cross frontiers and become new elements of the oak forests. [25]In eastern North America, rare species of oak trees include scarlet oak ( Quercus coccinea ), chinkapin oak ( Quercus muehlenbergii ), and post oak ( Quercus stellata ). [26]The mature trees shed varying numbers of acorns annually. Scientists suggest that shedding excess numbers allows the oaks to satiate nut gathering species, improving the chances of germination. Every four to ten years, certain oak populations will synchronize to produce almost no acorns at all, only to rain them down excessively the following year, known as a \\\"mast\\\" year. The year preceding the mast year is thought to starve off the mammal populations feeding on the supply, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the overproduction in the mast year that follows. [27] [28] This is necessary to the survival of any given oak species, as only one in 10,000 acorns results in an eventual tree. [29]Genetics Beginning November 1, 2011, a project began to sequence the entire oak genome. The goal of the project is to create a high resolution sequence of the Quercus robur genome, and to study genetic diversity by comparison of the genomes of different species. [30] Current research has compiled genomic data from many different sources and techniques to create a genome map with 89% coverage of the genome. The project is still in the process of annotating this genome. [31]Diseases and pests See also: List of Lepidoptera that feed on oaks Oak powdery mildew on pedunculate oak Sudden oak death ( Phytophthora ramorum) is a water mould that can kill oaks within just a few weeks. Oak wilt, caused by the fungus Ceratocystis fagacearum (a fungus closely related to Dutch elm disease ), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include wood-boring beetles, as well as root rot in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong gale. Oak apples are galls on oaks made by the gall wasp. The female kermes scale causes galls to grow on kermes oak. Oaks are used as food plants by the larvae of Lepidoptera ( butterfly and moth) species such as the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America. [32]A considerable number of galls are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, roots, etc. Examples are oak artichoke gall, oak marble gall, oak apple gall, knopper gall, and spangle gall. A number of species of fungus cause powdery mildew on oak species. In Europe the species Erysiphe alphitoides is the most common cause. [33]A new and yet little understood disease of mature oaks, acute oak decline, has been reported in parts of the UK since 2009. [34]Oak processionary moth ( Thaumetopoea processionea) has become a serious threat in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees, and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems. [35]In California, oaks are affected by the fungal disease Foamy bark canker. Toxicity The leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to cattle, horses, sheep, and goats in large amounts due to the toxin tannic acid, and cause kidney damage and gastroenteritis. Symptoms of poisoning include lack of appetite, depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), blood in urine, and colic. The exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the domestic pig, which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish dehesa and the English system of pannage) for hundreds of years. Acorns are also edible to humans, after leaching of the tannins. [36]Cultural significance Oak branches on the coat of arms of Estonia National symbol The oak is a common symbol of strength and endurance and has been chosen as the national tree of many countries. Already an ancient Germanic symbol (in the form of the Donar Oak, for instance), certainly since the early nineteenth century, it stands for the nation of Germany and oak branches are thus displayed on some German coins, both of the former Deutsche Mark and the current Euro currency. [37] In 2004 the Arbor Day Foundation [38] held a vote for the official National Tree of the United States of America. In November 2004, the United States Congress passed legislation designating the oak as America's National Tree. [39]Other countries have also designated the oak as their national tree including Bulgaria, Cyprus ( Golden Oak ), England, Estonia, France, Germany, Moldova, Jordan, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Wales. [40]Oaks as regional and state symbols The oak is the emblem of County Londonderry in Northern Ireland, as a vast amount of the county was covered in forests of the tree until relatively recently. The name of the county comes from the city of Derry, which originally in Irish was known as Doire meaning oak. The Irish County Kildare derives its name from the town of Kildare which originally in Irish was Cill Dara meaning the Church of the Oak or Oak Church. Iowa designated the oak as its official state tree in 1961; and the White Oak is the state tree of Connecticut, Illinois and Maryland. The Northern Red Oak is the provincial tree of Prince Edward Island, as well as the state tree of New Jersey. The Live Oak is the state tree of Georgia, USA. The oak is a national symbol from the Basque Country, specially in the province of Biscay. The oak is a symbol of the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area; the coat-of-arms and flag of Oakland, California feature the oak and the logo of the East Bay Regional Park District is an oak leaf. The coat-of-arms of Vest-Agder, Norway, and Blekinge, Sweden, features oak trees. The coat-of-arms of the municipality Eigersund, Norway features an oak leaf. Oak leaves are traditionally an important part of German Army regalia. [ citation needed] The Nazi party used the traditional German eagle, standing atop of a swastika inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the Iron Eagle. During the Third Reich of Nazi Germany, oak leaves were used for military valor decoration on the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross. They also symbolize rank in the United States Armed Forces. A gold oak leaf indicates an O-4 ( Major or Lt. Commander ), whereas a silver oak leaf indicates an O-5 ( Lt. Colonel or Commander ). Arrangements of oak leaves, acorns and sprigs indicate different branches of the United States Navy Staff corps officers. [41] Oak leaves are embroidered onto the covers (hats) worn by field grade officers and flag officers in the United States armed services. If a member of the United States Army or Air Force earns multiple awards of the same medal, then instead of wearing a ribbon or medal for each award, he or she wears one metal representation of an \\\" oak leaf cluster \\\" attached to the appropriate ribbon for each subsequent award. [42]Political use The oak tree is used as a symbol by a number of political parties. It is the symbol of Toryism (on account of the Royal Oak) and the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, [43] and formerly of the Progressive Democrats in Ireland [44] and the Democrats of the Left in Italy. In the cultural arena, the oakleaf is the symbol of the National Trust (UK), The Woodland Trust, and The Royal Oak Foundation. [41]Religious Gr\\u012bdnieku ancient oak in Rumbas parish, Latvia, girth 8.27m, 2015In Greek mythology, the oak is the tree sacred to Zeus, king of the gods. In Zeus's oracle in Dodona, Epirus, the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak's leaves. [45]In Baltic and Slavic mythology, the oak is the sacred tree of Latvian P\\u0113rkons, Lithuanian Perk\\u016bnas, Prussian Perk\\u016bns and Slavic Perun, [46] the god of thunder and one of the most important deities in the Baltic and Slavic pantheons. In Celtic polytheism, the name of the oak tree was part of the Proto-Celtic word for 'druid': *derwo-weyd- > *druwid- ; however, Proto-Celtic *derwo- (and *dru-) can also be adjectives for 'strong' and 'firm', so Ranko Matasovic interprets that *druwid- may mean 'strong knowledge'. As in other Indo-European faiths, Taranis, being a thunder god, was associated with the oak tree. [47] The Indo-Europeans worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder or lightning god; \\\"tree\\\" and drus may also be cognate with \\\"Druid,\\\" the Celtic priest to whom the oak was sacred. There has even been a study that shows that oaks are more likely to be struck by lightning than any other tree of the same height. [48]In Norse mythology, the oak was sacred to the thunder god, Thor. Thor's Oak was a sacred tree of the Germanic Chatti tribe. In the Bible, the oak tree at Shechem is the site where Jacob buries the foreign gods of his people (Gen. 35:4) . In addition, Joshua erects a stone under an oak tree as the first covenant of the Lord (Josh. 24.25\\u20137). In Isaiah 61, the prophet refers to the Israelites as \\\"Oaks of Righteousness.\\\" Absalom's long hair (2 Samuel 18:9) gets caught in an oak tree, and allows Joab to kill him. The badnjak is central tradition in Serbian Orthodox Church Christmas celebration where young and straight oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve. In some traditions of Wicca, the Oak King is one of the two faces of the Sun God. He is born on Yule and rules from Ostara to Mabon.

The Emancipation Oak is designated one of the 10 Great Trees of the World by the National Geographic Society and is part of the National Historic Landmark district of Hampton University. The Ivenack Oak which is one of the largest trees in Europe is located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany, and is approximately 800 years old. [53]The Bowthorpe Oak, located in Bourne, Lincolnshire, is thought to be 1,000 years old. It was featured in the Guinness Book of World Records and was filmed for a TV documentary for its astonishing longevity. [53]The Minchenden (or Chandos) Oak, in Southgate, London, is said to be the largest oak tree in England (already 27 feet or 8.2 meters in girth in the nineteenth century), and is perhaps 800 years old. [54]The Seven Sisters Oak is the largest certified southern live oak tree. Located in Mandeville, Louisiana, it is estimated to be up to 1,500 years old with a trunk that measures 38 ft (11.6 meters). [55] [56]The Major Oak is an 800 to 1000-year-old tree located in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. According to folklore, it was used by Robin Hood for shelter. Friendship Oak is a 500-year-old southern live oak located in Long Beach, Mississippi. The Crouch Oak is believed to have originated in the 11th Century and is located in Addlestone, Surrey. It is an important symbol of the town with many local businesses adopting its name. It used to mark the boundary of Windsor Great Park. Legend says that Queen Elizabeth I stopped by it and had a picnic. The Angel Oak is a southern live oak located in Angel Oak Park on John's Island near Charleston, South Carolina. The Angel Oak is estimated to be in excess of 400\\u2013500 years old, stands 66.5 ft (20.3 m) tall, and measures 28 ft (8.5 m) in circumference. The Kaiser's Oak, located at the village of Gommecourt in Artois, France, named in honour of Kaiser Wilhelm II, symbolically marked from late 1914 to April 1917 the furthest point in the West of the German Imperial Army during World War One. The Wye Oak in Maryland was the United States' largest white oak tree before it blew down in a storm in 2002, at an estimated age of 460 years. Historical note on Linnaean species Linnaeus described only five species of oak from eastern North America, based on general leaf form. These were white oak, Quercus alba; chestnut oak, Q. montana; red oak, Q. rubra; willow oak Q. phellos; and water oak, Q. nigra. Because he was dealing with confusing leaf forms, the Q. montana and Q. rubra specimens actually included mixed foliage of more than one species.

Cook County, 22 miles SW of the Loop. Central to Homewood's evolution from a whistle-stop farming center to a substantial suburb of a large city is its location on the Illinois Central Railroad . There is no evidence of a Native American settlement in Homewood, but the Vincennes Trace (now Dixie Highway) ran through the town. The area drains into the Calumet River . Homewood lies in four townships \\u2014Bloom, Bremen, Rich, and Thornton; it formally organized as a village in 1893. Immediately after federal surveyors marked the section lines around Homewood in 1834, settlers bought land and started farms. In 1852, a year after the first store opened, the business district was platted as Hartford. The next year the Illinois Central Railroad commenced service with a stop called Thornton Station, because most passengers were traveling to or from nearby Thornton . In 1869 the U. S. Postmaster General assented to a petition from local residents and officially changed the name to Homewood. Through the nineteenth century the town grew slowly. Farmers shipped their produce to Chicago, and local businesses and some industry developed to serve their needs, including a flourmill that operated from 1856 into the 1880s. The population in 1900 was 352. In the twentieth century, recreation began to draw visitors, some of whom became residents. Five early golf clubs still operate: Flossmoor Country Club, in neighboring Flossmoor (organized in 1898 as Homewood Country Club, name changed 1914); Ravisloe (1901); Idlewild, in Flossmoor (1908); Olympia Fields, in Olympia Fields (1915); and Calumet (organized in 1901 in Chicago, relocated to Homewood in 1917). The Illinois Central offered special schedules and created special stops just for golfers. That was the origin of the stops that became Calumet, Flossmoor, and Olympia Fields. The railroad attracted more new residents to both towns by selling real estate in Flossmoor and, in 1926, by electrifying its commuter service. Homewood's population grew from 713 in 1910 to 1,389 in 1920 and 3,227 in 1930. Relatively little direct benefit accrued from another recreational attraction, Washington Park Race Track, which opened in 1926 on grounds located west of Halsted Street just outside the village bounds. Few of the horse racing aficionados who patronized the track shopped or ate in Homewood, because the Illinois Central built a spur line so passengers could ride directly between Chicago and the track. During the Great Depression , the Illinois Jockey Association helped Homewood pay for infrastructure built during the optimistic, prosperous 1920s. Washington Park went out of business after its grandstand burned in 1977; in 1992 Homewood bought the site and turned it into a commercial and retail development. In the postwar period, Homewood and Flossmoor established institutional partnerships. Homewood-Flossmoor Community High School opened its doors in 1959, and a joint park district was incorporated in 1969. The Great Depression and World War II merely slowed growth. There were 4,078 people in 1940, but a surge pushed the total to 13,371 in 1960. Total population hit 18,871 in 1970 and since then has steadied between 19,000 and 20,000. By the 1970s, Homewood had become a virtual bedroom for Chicago\\u2014in 1967 Homewood and Flossmoor formed one of only three outlying suburban zones where half or more of the workers commuted to jobs in Chicago\\u2014and the trend continued into the twenty-first century.

            "Why Car Buyers Buy Business Journal October 14, 2004Print Why Car Buyers Buyby William J. Mc Ewen Author of Married to the Brand Yet another comprehensive study of auto buyers ignores the enormous impact of consumer emotions A recent study of automobile buyers has concluded that there are only two critical factors that influence car-buying decisions in the United States: \"product excellence\" and \"cost of ownership.\" According to the Booz Allen consultancy, which conducted the study, these two factors account for about 90% of the perceived differences among alternative vehicle brands. The study, which was the result of an intensive investigation into a decade of automobile buyer data, seems to have crystal clear implications for auto marketers and their ad agencies. As one Booz Allen vice president states, \"If the pictures people are seeing don't show the functional attributes of the vehicle, you're wasting your money.\" Lifestyle and \"feel-good\" advertising, he further contends, fall flat because they completely ignore the real reasons people buy. This seems to make perfect sense. People buy cars for functional reasons, so they need products that perform. They use these products to commute to the office, pick up groceries, schlep the kids to soccer practice, and tow the family outboard to the lake on Friday. What they want -- and need -- to know is how the car will hold up and what sort of long-term return they can expect to get for their large investment. In large-scale studies such as this one, abundant data show that functional attributes are enormously important to consumers. The conclusion is, when it comes to spending thousands of dollars, people are logical. Aren't they? Maybe now we know the real reasons why SUVs are so popular: People apparently love to go off-roading -- and they obviously need that 4-wheel-drive capability -- on the way to get groceries in Los Angeles and Miami. And we also know why middle-aged urban males buy sports cars -- they're just perfect for an urban commute on a gridlocked interstate. And, of course, they always buy the better rated, higher resale value option. Or, could it simply be that when people are asked for the \"reasons why\" they buy things -- including cars -- they'll usually offer up logical reasons, mainly because they believe it's important to appear logical? Ferrari and Hummer owners can, and will, talk about their vehicle's resale value and its impressive performance features. But they buy these cars because of how owning these brands makes them feel. Let us \"reason\" together Lots of studies report the \"reasons\" people give for the purchases they make, then correlate consumers' ratings of various product features with their reported intentions or purchases. In many of these studies, buyers appear to be quite rational. As in the Booz Allen report, they appear to make decisions based on product quality and costs. But perhaps consumer decisions only appear \"rational\" because of the way many companies measure these decisions -- and what they include in that measurement. If there's a factor that companies haven't been able to measure, or measure adequately, then it's no surprise that it's overlooked in their analysis. However, these other factors do exist, and they do have an impact, in spite of the fact that many researchers fail to measure them. In his book How Consumers Think, Jerry Zaltman points out the fallacy of assuming that consumers make linear, logical choices simply because when asked about their decisions, buyers typically describe them that way. Do functional attributes count? Of course they do. But Gallup Organization research has revealed that the strength of the connection between a customer and a brand has an essential -- and reliably measurable -- emotional component. (See \"Getting Emotional About Brands,\" \"The Engagement Imperative,\" and \"The Constant Customer\" in See Also. )In case after case, Gallup has found that brand relationships are not simply rationally driven or logically grounded. They are also emotional. We have found that the strongest -- and certainly the most profitable -- auto buyer relationships are marked not just by confidence in vehicle performance, but also by real passion for the brand. Moving metal or building relationships? In a study of 904 recent (past-four-year) auto purchasers, Gallup researchers found that customers' perceptions of the durability of their vehicles was the number-one factor in building customer confidence and the number-two factor in building passion for their cars. (See sidebar: \"Levels of Customer Engagement. \")But vehicle quality, we found, does not account for 90% of the brand relationship. Beyond product attributes, there are other crucial factors that reflect the entire ownership experience, and these must be taken into account. For example, customers who stated that their auto dealer sales and service reps were \"extremely helpful\" were, on average, 11 times more likely to have passion for their cars. And in another study, we found that owners of Toyotas and Hondas, both of which are highly rated for their vehicle quality, were 10 to 15 times more disposed to repurchase those vehicle brands if they felt that their dealers provided outstanding customer service. Brand passion depends on more than just functional attributes. Gallup has found that emotional connections play a vital role in auto buyers' brand relationships. That doesn't mean obscure or obtuse \"image\" advertising campaigns, such as the much-bashed \"rocks and trees\" introductory Infiniti campaign, are the best approach to the brand-building challenge. But it also doesn't mean that \"rational\" product attribute displays should necessarily be the focus of every brand's advertising message. Vague and toothless brand promises, whether they are presented through image ads or hard sell feature-focused ads, won't build strong brand relationships. In fact, although advertising is the tool that marketers reach for most often when they want to establish and reinforce emotional connections with customers, it's seldom their most powerful one. Indeed, Gallup has found that advertising pales next to what happens at the dealership. Emotions are powerful brand differentiators, and they demonstrably affect consumer decisions, regardless of whether they're being recognized and addressed. Auto manufacturers who want to build strong emotional ties with consumers must do more than merely focus on functional attributes and strive for the reduction of vehicle defects. Customers aren't just \"touched\" by the quality and price of the vehicle or by the informational content of its advertising. Their perceptions are formed -- and their emotions are engaged -- by their experiences while their car is in the service bay, the treatment they receive during the financing process, the appreciative stares of their neighbors, and the time they spend on hold waiting to talk to a customer service representative. Those are the moments that enhance or endanger brand relationships. Keith Crain said it quite well in an Automotive News editorial a few years ago: \"Reliability, real value for your price, real quality without any exceptions. Those are just the price of admission . . . But in the end, you must have something that creates passion in the mind of the buyer. \"We agree. With apologies to Ford, quality may be job one, but it clearly isn't the only one. William J. Mc Ewen, Ph. D., is the author of Married to the Brand.

Just like Ireland, Scotland has its own state bank en its own en ook eigen banknotes that are sometimes refused in other parts of the United Kingdom. Road network Most roads are good, but there are a lot of single track roads in the Highlands, very narrow roads. Fuel prices For actual fuel prices in all European countries see Autotraveler.ru. Code licence plate UKTelephone countrycode 44Internet countrycode .uk Time difference GMT; 1 hour earlier than in the Netherlands Geographic data Scotland is part of the United Kingdom (officially: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland), but most people call it just England which is not really true. The last countings tell there are about 5.2 million inhabitants at this moment, an average population density of 66 people per square kilometer (the average in the whole UK is 381 p. sq. km.). But the number of people is declining and the expectation is there will be no more than 5 million people in 2026. Scotland makes up for almost 35% of the surface of the UK (78.722 sq. km. ), but only 9.5% of the population lives there. Scotland and it's offshore islands are the northern part of the British island. On the west and north coast the Atlantic forms the border and in the east coast the Northsea. In the south the border with England goes over the Cheviott Hills, for 90 kilometers. The biggest distance from north to south on the Scottish mainland (Cape Wrath - Mull of Kintyre) is 441 km. and from east to west (Applecross-Peterhead) 248 km. The west coast is, in a straight line, 416 km. long, but in reality (because of the many bays) 3200 km. Scotland counts 790 islands, of which 130 are inhabited. Geografically Scotland consists of 2 parts: the mainland and the islands. On the mainland, one can discern 3 clear landmasses: the northen Highlands, the central Highlands and the Lowlands. The Highlands are divded by the Great Glen, a narrow gap in the mountain landscape. For a matter of fact, the glens are very characteristic to the whole country. They are valleys, made by glaciers with steep walls and often with elongated lakes (lochs). The highest top in this area (and of the whole of the UK) is Ben Nevis (1344 meters), near Fort William. Population The population distinguishes itself from the English through it's own language and literature, jurisdiction, education and organisation of the church. The Scots have a strong historical consciousness. The greater part of the population springs from the original Scottish population, which in fact is a jumble of Picts, Celts and Normans. Contrary to the rest of the UK, less people live in the cities and more in the countryside. With a population density of 66 people per square kilometer it is fairly quiet. Yet the distribution is very uneven: more than 1.5 of the 5 million inhabitants lives in one of the 4 big cities: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee. Our experiences have shown us that the people are very friendly and helpful, but they seem to have an inferiority complex in relation to the English; they still feel being dominated by them. It is almost, after centuries of British rule, as if it is genetically determined. Languages English is the official language of Scotland, but one can clearly discern a Scottish kind of english, a dialect. In the Highlands there are still people who speak Gaelic. Gaelic springs from the various (6) Celtic languages of the past and nowadays 3 forms have survived: Irish Gaelic (Gaeilge), Manx Gaelic (Gailck) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig). These 3 languages are being spoken in Ireland, on the island Man and in Scotland. The speakers of these languages are called Gaels (formerly Celts). About 60.000 people in Scotland still speak it, so not more than 1% of the total population! A few centuries ago there were 3 more languages besides English: Pictic, Gaelic and Norwegian. In the present Scottish language many words pop up from these 3 languages. Climate Scotland lies on the edge of the European continent and is surrounded by water on 3 sides. It has a moderate seaclimate with soft winters and cool summers. A belt of westward winds continuously sends a dense layer of clouds over the land. The west coast is generally wetter than the east but less windy. On the east coast the rainfall averages 650mm and on the west coast it averages 1500mm. Average summer highs are about 19 degrees and winter temperatures rarely drop below 0 degrees. Generally, there is snow in the higher areas from December until March. For the most sunshine and a minimum of rain, one has to go there in May or June. July and August are hotter, but also more wet and there are countless midgets. The autumn really can be called unstable: sometimes beuatiful and dry, sometimes wet, but quiet, sometimes very stormy. From experience we know that for the last few years the weather is very unpredictable and different than it used to be: too much rain and low temperatures. We never went for the weather, but seem to have been quite lucky: most days were dry and on almost every day we saw at least a bit of sunshine. In Scotland, the weather can show every season in a single day! Even on the sunniest of days care needs to be taken on the hills and mountains. On a mountain, within only 5 minutes, a mist can envelope a walker and make navigation difficult. On the other hand, brooding clouds can ease to spectacular shafts of bright sunlight. Flora and fauna The Highlands are barren and unhospitable. The landscape consists of infertile plains without trees. The vegetation includes heather, fern, a variety of grasses, Juneper berry and similar small bushes. Some 4.000 years ago, there were mainly pine trees (Scots pine), but deforestation, intensive grazing by sheep and changes in climate, have replaced the once extensive woods with a thick layer of peat. Reforesting has begun, but the new woods are quite one-sided and monotonous. There is a great variety of birds, near the coast more than in the inetrior. On the islands and on the steep cliffs of the mainland, many seabirds nest, like ospreys, auks, terns and gannets. In the mountain areas there are golden eagles and ravens, on the moors snow hen and pheasants and owls and sangbirds in the woods. The largest mammal on land is the deer, which causes a lot of damage to new plantations and nests of rare birds. Big mammals, like the wolf, beaver, beer and elk are extinct already in the 18th century. The sheep, the Scottish Highlanders, and also the Shetland pony's, which all walk about freely, are half wild. Economy For centuries, the economical development of Scotland lagged behind that of England, it's location being one reason. This results in emigration from many people from this area to make money somewhere else. Edinburgh is the financial center of the country. There, also the Bank of Scotland is established (where they make their own Scottish bank notes). Tourism still is important to the economy of the country, although, for various reasons, it is less than it used to be. Almost 80% of the Scottish soil is used for agricultural purposes. In the South and Middle Scotland there are vast farming areas, where cattle breeding is the main activity. Nevertheless, The mouth and foot disease disaster in 2001 hurt Scotland, economically, more in tourism than in the agrarian sector. The fishing industry is important along all of the coast (haddock, codfish, herring, crustaceans). The breeding of salmon also appears. Most important places with a fishing industry are: Aberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Kinlochbervie, Lerwick and Ullapool. Among the minerals, which Scotland possesses, are coal (in Lothian, Fife and Ayr) and iron ore (in het south west, Strathclyde). But, like in other parts of the UK, mining industry is declining. The mining of oil and gas from the Northsea is also of importance to Scotland's economy. True Scottish export articles are whisky (mostly to the United States), woolen fabrics (tweed) and foods. Most important buyers are England and the countries of the Commonwealth. Scotland has a good road and railway network. There are four international airports: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Prestwick, and several smaller airports, used for local traffic. Tourism Tourism is very important to the economy of Scotland, but it has suffered a lot from cattle ailments the last few years, like the foot and mouth disease and the mad cow disease. And after the attacks on September 11th 2001, the American tourists stayed away. This, of course, applies for the whole of Europe and the British government has taken all sorts of measures to increase the numbers of tourists again, but as yet Scottish tourism is doing badly. But we couldn't find accurate data on this. The Scottish-English conflict The Scots are very proud of their country, nationalistic even; this is proven by their history and we noticed it ourselves also. Since 1999, July the first, Scotland has its own Parliament in Edinburgh, after 292 years. It has very limited powers and responsibilities, with major policy (taxation, economy, transport, defence, foreign policy, broadcasting) still decided by Westminster - but it is a Parliament nonetheless. There are 129 members of Scottish Parliament who can decide on other matters, under the direction of the first minister. Many Scots still feel the dependancy to the UK (and England) is too great and think they are being put at a disadvantage compared to the other parts of the kingdom. There have been studies about the division of financial support, which proved that Scotland got it's share and maybe even more. The majority of the people want self-government to a larger extent, but are not striving for total independance. Yet there are political movements whose aims are self-rule and independance. The Scottisch National Party is a party which claims to look after the interests of the Scottish people. The party was founded in 1934, when circumstances of life were miserable for the workers and Scotland was neglected by the UK. A website from the movement Siol nan Gaidheal about the independance of Scotland can be found here.

[1] It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against peacetime targets or in war against non-combatants. [2] The terms \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century [3] but gained mainstream popularity during the U. S. Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981–89) after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings [4] and again after the attacks on New York City and Washington, D. C. in September 2001 [5] [4] [6] and on Bali in October 2002. [4]There is no commonly accepted definition of \"terrorism\". [7] [8] Being a charged term, with the connotation of something \"morally wrong\", it is often used, both by governments and non-state groups, to abuse or denounce opposing groups. [9] [10] [4] [11] [8] Broad categories of political organisations have been claimed to have been involved in terrorism to further their objectives, including right-wing and left-wing political organisations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments. [12] Terrorism-related legislation has been adopted in various states, regarding \"terrorism\" as a crime. [13] [14] There is no universal agreement as to whether or not \"terrorism\", in some definition, should be regarded as a war crime. [14] [15]According to the Global Terrorism Database by the University of Maryland, College Park, more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, have been recorded from 2000 to 2014.

The Latin verb terrere means: to frighten. [17] The English word 'terror', just like the French terreur, derives from that Latin word and means from of old: fright, alarm, anguish, (mortal) fear, panic. Oxford English Dictionary reportedly states that the word 'terrorist' (French: terroriste) was invented in the year 1794, during the French Revolution. The first meaning of the word 'terrorist' was then: adherent or supporter of the Jacobins. [18] Apparent from the context given in an article in the Guardian, the indication 'Jacobins' in that Oxford definition bears on the group around Maximilien Robespierre, also called 'Montagnards', that after 1794 were held responsible by some commentators for the repressive and violent government over France between June 1793 and July 1794, a period analogously labeled ' Reign of Terror ' by commentators. [18] The given definition in Oxford Dictionary shows, the term 'terrorist' in its first use was meant as abusive term for someone's political or historical ideas or allegiances, not as description of his personal actions. [18]In December 1795, Edmund Burke used the word \"Terrorists\" in a description of the new French government called 'Directory': \"At length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens (…) To secure them further, they have a strong corps of irregulars, ready armed. Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people.\" [19] Clearly, in this case, Burke used 'Terrorists' as disparaging labeling of armed troops hired by a government he loathes. French historian Sophie Wahnich (French) distinguishes between the revolutionary terror of the French Revolution and the terrorists of the September 11 attacks: Revolutionary terror is not terrorism. To make a moral equivalence between the Revolution's year II and September 2001 is historical and philosophical nonsense . . . The violence exercised on 11 September 2001 aimed neither at equality nor liberty. Nor did the preventive war announced by the president of the United States.

(March 2017)Attack at the Bologna railway station on 2 August 1980 by the neo-fascist group Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. With 85 deaths, it is the deadliest massacre in the history of Italy as a Republic. There are over 109 different definitions of terrorism. [22] U. S. American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: \"Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders\". [8] This meaning can be traced back to Sergey Nechayev, who described himself as a \"terrorist\". [23] Nechayev founded the Russian terrorist group \"People's Retribution\" (Народная расправа) in 1869. [24]In November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act \"intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act\". [25] Alternatively, responding to developments in modern warfare, Paul James and Jonathan Friedman distinguish between state terrorism against non-combatants and state terrorism against combatants, including ' Shock and Awe ' tactics:\"Shock and Awe\" as a subcategory of \"rapid dominance\" is the name given to massive intervention designed to strike terror into the minds of the enemy. It is a form of state-terrorism. The concept was however developed long before the Second Gulf War by Harlan Ullman as chair of a forum of retired military personnel. [26]But defining terrorism has proven controversial. Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation. Moreover, the international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime. These difficulties arise from the fact that the term \"terrorism\" is politically and emotionally charged. [27] [28] In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination. [29]These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism. [30] The international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them. [31]U. S. Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f (d) defines terrorism as: \"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience\". [32]Bruce Hoffman, an American scholar, has noted: It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, 'Political Terrorism: A Research Guide,' Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definitions of terrorism in an effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schmid was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the \"search for an adequate definition is still on\". Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. [33]Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that: The Baghdad bus station was the scene of a triple car bombing in August 2005 that killed 43 people. By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:ineluctably political in aims and motives;violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;andperpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity. [34]A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism: Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience (s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states. [35]Oslo, Norway immediately after the 2011 terrorist attack in Norway perpetrated by Anders Behring Breivik Each act of terrorism is a \"performance\" devised to affect many large audiences. Terrorists also attack national symbols, [36] to show power and to attempt to shake the foundation of the country or society they are opposed to. This may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist group and/or ideology behind a terrorist act. [37]Terrorist acts frequently have a political purpose. [38] This is often where the inter-relationship between terrorism and religion occurs. When a political struggle is integrated into the framework of a religious or \"cosmic\" [39] struggle, such as over the control of an ancestral homeland or holy site such as Israel and Jerusalem, failing in the political goal (nationalism) becomes equated with spiritual failure, which, for the highly committed, is worse than their own death or the deaths of innocent civilians. [40]Their suffering accomplishes the terrorists' goals of instilling fear, getting their message out to an audience or otherwise satisfying the demands of their often radical religious and political agendas. [41]Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act. [42] [ better source needed] to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus \"lawful\") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups. For example, carrying out a strategic bombing on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government. This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted, [ attribution needed] because: it denies the existence of state terrorism; [43] the same act may or may not be classed as terrorism depending on whether its sponsorship is traced to a \"legitimate\" government; \"legitimacy\" and \"lawfulness\" are subjective, depending on the perspective of one government or another; and it diverges from the historically accepted meaning and origin of the term. [44] [45] [46] [47]According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment. [48]An associated, and arguably more easily definable, but not equivalent term is violent non-state actor. [49] The semantic scope of this term includes not only \"terrorists\", but while excluding some individuals or groups who have previously been described as \"terrorists\", and also explicitly excludes state terrorism. U. S. president Barack Obama, commenting on the Boston Marathon bombings of April 2013, declared that \" [a]nytime bombs are used to target innocent civilians, it is an act of terror\". [50] Various commentators have pointed out the distinction between \"act of terror\" and \"terrorism\", particularly when used by the White House. [51] [52] 18 U. S. C. § 2331 defines \"international terrorism\" and \"domestic terrorism\" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled \"Terrorism\":\"International terrorism\" means activities with the following three characteristics: Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law; Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and Occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U. S., or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum. Pejorative use [ edit]See also: Controversies about Labeling Terrorism Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state-groups. [9] [10] [4] [11] [8]Those labeled \"terrorists\" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures. Jihadi, mujaheddin, and fedayeen are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon. It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists. [53]On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the \"harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism\". [54] Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when \"a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so\". [54] [55]In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted: On one point, at least, everyone agrees: terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view. Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism. [56] [57] [58]President Reagan meeting with Afghan Mujahideen leaders in the Oval Office in 1983The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, \"One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\". [53] This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally. During World War II, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army was allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor (the Malayan Races Liberation Army ), were branded \"terrorists\" by the British. [59] [60] More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the mujaheddin \"freedom fighters\" during the Soviet–Afghan War [61] yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks were labelled \"terrorism\" by George W. Bush. [62] [63] [64] Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action. [65] [66] [67] Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines \"terrorist acts\" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said: There is the famous statement: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.' But that is grossly misleading. It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act. One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts, it is terrorism regardless. [68]Some groups, when involved in a \"liberation\" struggle, have been called \"terrorists\" by the Western governments or media. Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called \"statesmen\" by similar organizations. Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela. [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74]Wiki Leaks editor Julian Assange has been called a \"terrorist\" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden. [75] [76]Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether or not members of a certain organization are terrorists. For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism. This was highlighted by the Quinn v. Robinson case. [77] [78]Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of \"terrorist\" and \"terrorism\" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms. [79] [80]See also: Violent non-state actor History [ edit]Main article: History of terrorism The Irish Republican Brotherhood was one of the earliest organizations to use modern terrorist tactics. Pictured, \"The Fenian Guy Fawkes \" by John Tenniel (1867). Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st-century AD. [81] Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist. According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed, [82] [83] Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD. [84] Their terror was also directed against Jewish \"collaborators\", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites. [85]The term \"terrorism\" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the \" Reign of Terror \" in the French Revolution. \"Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible\", said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre. In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting \"thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists ... loose on the people\" of France. In January 1858, Italian patriot Felice Orsini threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napoleon III. [86] Eight bystanders were killed and 142 injured. [86] The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups. [86]Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, [87] founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group [88] that carried out attacks in England. [89] The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns. [90] Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used modern, timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains. [91]Another early terrorist group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and \" propaganda by the deed \" theorist Carlo Pisacane. [81] [92] [93] The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'—that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of [94] —enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination. [95]Scholars of terrorism refer to four major waves of global terrorism: \"the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious. The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade.\" [96]Infographics [ edit]See also: Number of terrorist incidents by country Terrorist incidents, 1970–2015.

Source: Europol. [97] [98] [99]Aftermath of the King David Hotel bombing by the Zionist militant group Irgun, July 1946A view of damage to the U. S. Embassy in the aftermath of the 1983 Beirut bombing caused by Islamic Jihad Organization and Hezbollah In early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals. One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled Disorders and Terrorism, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H. H. A. Cooper, Director of the Task Force staff. The Task Force defines terrorism as \"a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes\". It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories: [100]Civil disorder – A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community. Political terrorism – Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes. Non-Political terrorism – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits \"conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective\". Quasi-terrorism – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient. It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction. [101] [102] [103] For example, the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different. Limited political terrorism – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach; limited political terrorism refers to \"acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state \". Official or state terrorism – \"referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions\". It may also be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy. Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism. [104] One way the typology of terrorism may be defined: [105] [106]Political terrorism Sub-state terrorism Social revolutionary terrorism Nationalist-separatist terrorism Religious extremist terrorism Religious fundamentalist Terrorism New religions terrorism Right-wing terrorism Left-wing terrorism State-sponsored terrorism Regime or state terrorism Criminal terrorism Pathological terrorism Motivations of terrorists [ edit]Attacks on 'collaborators' are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control. This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles. Attacks on high-profile symbolic targets are used to incite counter-terrorism by the state to polarize the population. [ clarification needed] [ citation needed] This strategy was used by Al-Qaeda in its attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the United States on September 11, 2001. These attacks are also used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported, such as the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the South Moluccan hostage crisis in the Netherlands in 1975. Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness. [107] Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined. [107] Additionally, Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism. [108] Many terrorists have a history of domestic violence. [109]Some terrorists like Timothy Mc Veigh were motivated by revenge against a state for its actions against its citizens. According to Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert on behalf of The Department of security of UK, 43% of lone wolf terrorism is motivated by religious beliefs. The same report indicates that Just less than a third (31.9%) have pre-existing mental health disorders, while many are found to have these problems upon arrest. At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26.1% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases. 40.2% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event. Many were chronically unemployed and consistently struggled to hold any form of employment for a significant amount of time. 19.3% subjectively experienced being disrespected by others, while 14.3% experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assault. [110]It is true that one of the main reasons behind terrorism is a strong religious belief however there are other factors such as cultural, social and political. Even though these reasons are like most around the world. The drive behind these Chechen terrorists are quite distinct and unique from others. Many of the Chechens considered themselves secular freedom fighters, nationalist insurgents seeking to establish an independent secular state of Chechnya. A distinction must be made from the beginning between national Chechen terrorists and non-Chechen fighters who have adopted the idea from abroad. Few Chechen fighters fought for the jihads although on the other hand most of the non-Chechen fighters did (Janeczko, 2014 [111]One of the major reasons why terrorists are motivated and perhaps eager to carry out horrific acts is assurance of financial stability for their families, that they are given when they join a terrorist organization. An extra grant is provided for the families of suicide bombers. [22]Democracy and domestic terrorism [ edit]The neutrality of this section is disputed.

(March 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)The relationship between domestic terrorism and democracy is very complex. Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations. [112] [113] [114] [115] However, one study suggests that suicide attacks may be an exception to this general rule. [ irrelevant citation] Evidence regarding this particular method of terrorism reveals that every modern suicide campaign has targeted a democracy–a state with a considerable degree of political freedom. [116] [ relevant? – discuss] [ verify] The study suggests that concessions awarded to terrorists during the 1980s and 1990s for suicide attacks increased their frequency. [ example needed] [ dubious – discuss] [117] There is a connection between the existence of civil liberties, democratic participation and terrorism. [ improper synthesis?] According to Young and Dugan, these things encourage terrorist groups to organize and generate terror. [118] [ non sequitur]Some examples of \"terrorism\" in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group's terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco's death), [119] the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, [120] the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, [121] the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders [ citation needed] and the ANC in South Africa. [122] Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have also experienced domestic terrorism. While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties. [123] For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden. [124] This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist (s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system. [125]Religious terrorism [ edit]Main article: Religious terrorism Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing. Some 35,000 Pakistanis have died from terrorist attacks in recent years. [126]Terrorist acts throughout history have been performed on religious grounds with the goal to either spread or enforce a system of belief, viewpoint or opinion. [127] [ dubious – discuss] [ irrelevant citation] The validity and scope of religious terrorism is limited to an individual's view or a group's view or interpretation of that belief system's teachings. [ citation needed] [ context? ]According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world. Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks. The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda. Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organisations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks. The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown. The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends. [128]Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL. These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. 80% of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries. [128]In 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on terrorism in the United States. The report (titled The Age of the Wolf) found that during that period, \"more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists .\" [129] The \"virulent racist and anti-semitic\" ideology of the ultra-right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments. [130] Adherents of Christian Identity believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the \" Lost Tribes of Israel \" and many consider Jews to be the Satanic offspring of Eve and the Serpent. [130] This group has committed hate crimes, bombings and other acts of terrorism. Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo-nazi groups to the anti-government militia and sovereign citizen movements. [130] Christian Identity 's origins can be traced back to Anglo-Israelism. Anglo-Israelism held the view that Jews were descendants of ancient Israelites who had never been lost. By the 1930s, the movement had been infected with anti-Semitism, and eventually Christian Identity theology diverged from traditional Anglo-Israelism, and developed what is known as the \"two seed\" theory. [130] According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from Cain and the serpent (not from Shem ). [130] The white European seedline is descended from the \"lost tribes\" of Israel. They hold themselves to \"God's laws\", not to \"man's laws\", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the New World Order. [130]Dawabsheh family home after Duma arson attack Israel has also had problems with Jewish religious terrorism. Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995. For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians. [131]Perpetrators [ edit]The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states. According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may also carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war. However, the most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells, highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the September 11 attacks, the London underground bombing, 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2002 Bali bombing were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks. These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed. [132]Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances. [133] Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists. Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non-state actors. [ citation needed] A 2007 study by economist Alan B. Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28% vs. 33%) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47% vs. 38%). Another analysis found only 16% of terrorists came from impoverished families, vs. 30% of male Palestinians, and over 60% had gone beyond high school, vs. 15% of the populace. A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether or not,terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others. This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist. [22] [134]To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission. Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful. [135] The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person. [136] However, the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16–40. [136]Non-state groups [ edit]There is speculation that anthrax mailed inside letters to U. S. politicians was the work of a lone wolf. Main articles: List of designated terrorist groups, Lone wolf (terrorism), and Violent non-state actor Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a \"terrorist\" in the media. State sponsors [ edit]Main article: State-sponsored terrorism A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group. Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely. When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such. [137] [ citation needed]State terrorism [ edit]Main article: State terrorism Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy. Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed. When it is noticed, it is fully rationalized. Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur it is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims.— Derrick Jensen [138]Infant crying in Shanghai's South Station after the Japanese bombing, 28 August 1937. As with \"terrorism\" the concept of \"state terrorism\" is controversial. [139] The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the Committee was conscious of 12 international Conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to State terrorism, which was not an international legal concept. If States abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law. [140] Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is \"time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'. The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law\". [141] However, he also made clear that, \"regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism.\" [142]USS Arizona (BB-39) burning during the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941. State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces. This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism. Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the British and American firebombing of Dresden, and the U. S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. He argues that \"the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents.\" He also cites the first strike option as an example of the \"terror of coercive diplomacy\" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in \"crisis management\" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II. In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state . [143] [144] [145]St Paul's Cathedral after the German bombing of London, c. 1940. Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone 's Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his \"no-Rent manifesto\" in 1881, during the Irish Land War. [146] The concept is also used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear. For example, taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered \"terror\" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror. [147] Such actions are also often described as democide or genocide, which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism. [148] Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide. [149] [150] Western democracies, including the United States, have supported state terrorism [151] and mass killings, [152] with some examples being the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–1966 and Operation Condor. [153] [154] [155]Connection with tourism [ edit]The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the Luxor massacre in Egypt. [156] [157] In the 1970s, the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now, international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, were the symbolic epicenter, which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet. [158] From this event onwards, the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West, were conceived as dangerous and frightful. [159] [160]. Funding [ edit]Main article: Terrorist financing State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding; for example, Palestine Liberation Organization, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the Soviet Union. [161] [162] The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British Mandate for Palestine. [163] Pakistan has created and nurtured terrorist groups as policy for achieving tactical objectives against its neighbours, especially India. [164]\" Revolutionary tax \" is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for \" protection money \". [161] Revolutionary taxes \"play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population\". [161]Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms, smuggling (including wildlife smuggling ), [165] fraud, and robbery. [161] The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding \"via private donations from the Gulf states \". [166]The Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating terrorist financing. [167]Tactics [ edit]Main article: Tactics of terrorism The Wall Street bombing at noon on September 16, 1920 killed thirty-eight people and injured several hundred. The perpetrators were never caught. [168]Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, usually using explosives or poison. [169] Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through organized crime. Communications occur through modern telecommunications, or through old-fashioned methods such as couriers. There is also concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction. Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare, and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because forces vary greatly in power. [170]The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict. The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include: Secession of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state Dominance of territory or resources by various ethnic groups Imposition of a particular form of government Economic deprivation of a population Opposition to a domestic government or occupying army Religious fanaticism Responses [ edit]Sign notifying shoppers of increased surveillance due to a perceived increased risk of terrorism Responses to terrorism are broad in scope. They can include re-alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values. Specific types of responses include: Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers Target hardening, such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers Preemptive or reactive military action Increased intelligence and surveillance activities Preemptive humanitarian activities More permissive interrogation and detention policies The term \" counter-terrorism \" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors. Response in the United States [ edit]See also: War on Terror X-ray backscatter technology ( AIT) machine used by the TSA to screen passengers. According to the TSA, this is what the remote TSA agent would see on their screen. According to a report by Dana Priest and William M. Arkin in The Washington Post, \"Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States.\" [171]America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought. Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East. Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home. [172] In the introduction of the U. S. Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, Sarah Sewall states the need for \"U. S. forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority. The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.... Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants––and erode support of the host nation.\" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: \"Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.... Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.... The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted.... Sometimes, doing nothing is the best reaction.\" [173] This strategy, often termed \"courageous restraint\", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield, yet it fails to address the central truth: the terrorists we face are mostly homegrown. [172]Terrorism research [ edit]Terrorism research, also called terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense. Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT). There are several academic journals devoted to the field. [174]Mass media [ edit]La Terroriste, a 1910 poster depicting a female member of the Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party throwing a bomb at a Russian official's car. Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media. Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media. [175]The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages. [176] This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements. The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource. [177]The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism. However, this may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media. Conversely James F. Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other. [178]There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt. A point at which the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself. Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media-related.— Novelist William Gibson [179]Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher also famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media, calling publicity 'the oxygen of terrorism'. [180]Outcome of terrorist groups [ edit]How terrorist groups end (n = 268): The most common ending for a terrorist group is to convert to nonviolence via negotiations (43 percent), with most of the rest terminated by routine policing (40 percent). Groups that were ended by military force constituted only 7 percent. [181]Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006. They found 648. of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006. [182] Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland. Law enforcement took out 40 percent. Ten percent won. Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were taken out by military force. Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006. Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors. Only 5 percent were taken out by law enforcement. 26 percent won. 21 percent succumbed to military force. [183] Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists. To avoid that, the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it. Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end: [184]Capture or killing of a group's leader. (Decapitation). Entry of the group into a legitimate political process. (Negotiation). Achievement of group aims. (Success). Group implosion or loss of public support. (Failure). Defeat and elimination through brute force. (Repression). Transition from terrorism into other forms of violence. (Reorientation).

A sequel to the 1979 film Alien, Aliens follows Weaver's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature, this time accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines. Aliens' action-adventure tone was in contrast to the horror motifs of the original Alien. Following the success of The Terminator, which helped establish Cameron as a major action director, 20th Century Fox greenlit Aliens with a budget of approximately $18 million. It was filmed in England at Pinewood Studios and at a decommissioned power plant. Aliens grossed $86 million at the US box office during its 1986 theatrical release and $131 million worldwide. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including a Best Actress nomination for Sigourney Weaver. It won in the categories of Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. It won eight Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress for Weaver and Best Direction and Best Writing for Cameron.

National Eye Institute To understand this diagram of the eye, try to picture it as being split in two, like an apple that's been cut in half. Imagine yourself looking into the eye from the cut side. The Cornea The cornea is a transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of your eye. It functions as a window and allows light to enter your eye. It also begins the process of focusing light rays that allow you to see words and images clearly. The cornea provides 65-75% of your eye's focusing power. The cornea does not contain any blood vessels, but instead contains many nerve endings that make it extremely sensitive. That is why a scratch or a loose eyelash is so painful. Jake Whalen: Living and Coping with Keratoconus Jake Whalen is a freelance copywriter who has struggled for most of his life with keratoconus. Keratoconus is a degenerative condition of the cornea, a transparent dome-shaped tissue that forms the front part of the eye. Keratoconus gradually causes the cornea to thin, bulge/protrude outward, and become cone-shaped. This creates an abnormal curvature of the eye that can cause blurred vision, glare problems, light sensitivity, and even extreme pain.

Aqueous Humor Aqueous humor is a clear, watery fluid, contained in two chambers behind the cornea, that helps to bring nutrients to the eye tissues. It is produced by the ciliary body, a ring of tissue that sits behind the iris. As it circulates, the aqueous fluid flows to the front part of the eye, where it is drained by the trabecular meshwork, a sponge-like filtering system located where the cornea and iris meet. After draining through the trabecular meshwork, the aqueous fluid then passes through a small duct, called the canal of Schlemm, and is absorbed into the bloodstream. The health of your eye depends upon a continuous process of production, flow, and drainage of this aqueous fluid. Any interruption of this process can lead to problems with increased pressure inside the eye, such as glaucoma. The Sclera The sclera is a tough white outer coating of fibrous tissue that covers your entire eyeball (all the way around) except for the cornea. The muscles that move the eye are attached to the sclera. The name sclera comes from the Greek word \"skleros,\" which means \"hard. \"The Iris and the Pupil The iris is a ring-shaped membrane inside the eye that surrounds an opening in the center, called the pupil. The iris contains muscles that allow the pupil to become larger (open up or dilate) and smaller (close up or constrict). The iris regulates the amount of light that enters your eye by adjusting the size of the pupil opening. In bright light, the iris closes (or constricts) and makes the pupil opening smaller to restrict the amount of light that enters your eye. The iris in bright light In dim light, the iris opens (or dilates) and makes the pupil opening larger to increase the amount of light that enters your eye: The iris in dim light In addition, it is the iris that determines your eye color. People with brown eyes have heavily pigmented irises, while people with blue or lighter-colored eyes have irises with less pigment. The Lens The lens is composed of transparent, flexible tissue and is located directly behind the iris and the pupil. It is the second part of your eye, after the cornea, that helps to focus light and images on your retina. Because the lens is flexible and elastic, it can change its curved shape to focus on objects and people that are either nearby or at a distance. The lens provides 25-35% of your eye's focusing power. The ciliary muscles, which are part of the ciliary body, are attached to the lens and contract or release to change the lens shape and curvature. The lens becomes more rounded to focus on near objects (see Figure 1): Fig. 1: A more rounded lens can focus on near objects. The lens becomes more elongated (or stretched) to focus on objects that are far away (see Figure 2): Fig. 2: A more elongated/stretched lens can focus on far objects Over time, the lens loses some of its elasticity and therefore loses some of its ability to focus on near objects. This is called presbyopia and explains why people need reading glasses as they become older. The Choroid The choroid is a dark brown membrane that is rich with blood vessels, located between the sclera and the retina. It supplies blood and nutrients to the retina and nourishes all of the other structures within the eye. The Vitreous The vitreous is the jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the back part of the eye. Over time, the vitreous becomes more liquid and can detach from the back part of the eye, which can create floaters. If you notice new floaters or flashing lights, it is important to see your eye doctor, because a detached vitreous can cause a hole (a condition called a macular hole) to develop in the retina. The Retina and Optic Nerve The retina is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside surface of the eye, much like wallpaper. Cells in the retina convert incoming light into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried by the optic nerve (which resembles your television cable) to the brain, which finally interprets them as visual images. The macula is the small sensitive area in the center of the retina that provides clear central vision. The fovea is located in the center of the macula and provides the sharpest detail vision. Some Facts about the Retina The retina is the light-sensitive tissue that lines the inside surface of the eye. The retina contains photoreceptor cells that convert (or process) incoming light into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses are carried by the optic nerve (which resembles your television cable) to the brain, which finally interprets them as visual images. There are two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones, which are the light-processing cells responsible for peripheral (side) and central (straight-ahead) vision. Rods The specialized, highly light-sensitive retinal processing cells that are able to function in low light levels. They provide peripheral (or side) vision, are responsible for dark adaptation, and are most sensitive to movement/motion. They are less sensitive to color perception. A normal retina contains approximately 120-150 million rods, primarily in the peripheral, or outer, retina. Rods provide scotopic vision which refers to eyesight in low light conditions. Cones The specialized retinal processing cells that function in bright light levels and provide central (or straight-ahead) vision, along with sharp visual acuity, detail, and color vision. They require bright light to function and are not sensitive to lower light levels. A normal retina contains approximately 6-7 million cones, primarily in the macula, the small area in the center of the retina that provides clear central vision. Cones are the most concentrated in the fovea, which is located in the center of the macula and provides the sharpest detail vision. Cones provide photopic vision, which refers to eyesight in daylight conditions.

[2] In humans, the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in other mammals the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. [3] In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. The human eye is relatively rare for having an iris that is small enough for its position to be plainly visible against the sclera. This makes it easier for one individual to infer where another individual is looking, and the cooperative eye hypothesis suggests this has evolved as a method of nonverbal communication. Contents [ hide ]1 Structure1.1 Histology2 Function3 Injury3.1 Trauma3.2 Thermal trauma3.3 Chemical injury4 Clinical significance5 Notes6 See also7 References8 External links Structure [ edit]Goat eye with relatively dark sclera and horizontal pupil Cow eye with dark sclera The sclera forms the posterior five-sixths of the connective tissue coat of the globe. It is continuous with the dura mater and the cornea, and maintains the shape of the globe, offering resistance to internal and external forces, and provides an attachment for the extraocular muscle insertions. The sclera is perforated by many nerves and vessels passing through the posterior scleral foramen, the hole that is formed by the optic nerve. At the optic disc the outer two-thirds of the sclera continues with the dura mater (outer coat of the brain) via the dural sheath of the optic nerve. The inner third joins with some choroidal tissue to form a plate ( lamina cribrosa) across the optic nerve with perforations through which the optic fibers ( fasciculi) pass. The thickness of the sclera varies from 1mm at the posterior pole to 0.3 mm just behind the rectus muscle insertions. The sclera\\'s blood vessels are mainly on the surface. Along with the vessels of the conjunctiva (which is a thin layer covering the sclera), those in the episclera render the inflamed eye bright red. [4]In many vertebrates, the sclera is reinforced with plates of cartilage or bone, together forming a circular structure called the sclerotic ring. In primitive fish, this ring consists of four plates, but the number is lower in many living ray-finned fishes, and much higher in lobe-finned fishes, various reptiles, and birds. The ring has disappeared in many groups, including living amphibians, some reptiles and fish, and all mammals. [5]The eyes of all non-human primates are dark with small, barely visible sclera. Histology [ edit]The collagen of the sclera is continuous with the cornea. From outer to innermost, the four layers of the sclera are:episclerastromalamina fuscaendothelium The sclera is opaque due to the irregularity of the Type I [6] collagen fibers, as opposed to the near-uniform thickness and parallel arrangement of the corneal collagen. Moreover, the cornea bears more mucopolysaccharide (a carbohydrate that has among its repeating units a nitrogenous sugar, hexosamine) to embed the fibrils. The cornea, unlike the sclera, has five layers. The middle, thickest layer is also called the stroma. The sclera, like the cornea, contains a basal endothelium, above which there is the lamina fusca, containing a high count of pigment cells. [4]Sometimes, very small gray-blue spots can appear on the sclera, a harmless condition called scleral melanocytosis. Function [ edit]Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. This is not just due to the white color of the human sclera, which many other species share, but also to the fact that the human iris is relatively small and comprises a significantly smaller portion of the exposed eye surface compared to other animals. It is theorized that this adaptation evolved because of our social nature as the eye became a useful communication tool in addition to a sensory organ. It is believed that the conspicuous sclera of the human eye makes it easier for one individual to infer where another individual is looking, increasing the efficacy of this particular form of nonverbal communication. [7] Animal researchers have also found that, in the course of their domestication, dogs have also developed the ability to pick up visual cues from the eyes of humans. Dogs do not seem to use this form of communication with one another and only look for visual information from the eyes of humans. [8]Injury [ edit]Trauma [ edit]The bony area that makes up the human eye socket provides exceptional protection to the sclera. However, if the sclera is ruptured by a blunt force or is penetrated by a sharp object, the recovery of full former vision is usually rare. If pressure is applied slowly, the eye is actually very elastic. However, most ruptures involve objects moving at some velocity. The cushion of orbital fat protects the sclera from head-on blunt forces, but damage from oblique forces striking the eye from the side is not prevented by this cushion. Hemorrhaging and a dramatic drop in intraocular pressure are common, along with a reduction in visual perception to only broad hand movements and the presence or absence of light. However, low-velocity injury which does not puncture and penetrate the sclera requires only superficial treatment and the removal of the object. Sufficiently small objects which become embedded and which are subsequently left untreated may eventually become surrounded by a benign cyst, causing no other damage or discomfort. [9]Thermal trauma [ edit]The sclera is rarely damaged by brief exposure to heat: the eyelids provide exceptional protection, and the fact that the sclera is covered in layers of moist tissue means that these tissues are able to cause much of the offending heat to become dissipated as steam before the sclera itself is damaged. Even relatively low-temperature molten metals when splashed against an open eye have been shown to cause very little damage to the sclera, even while creating detailed casts of the surrounding eyelashes. Prolonged exposure, however— on the order of 30 seconds— at temperatures above 45 °C (113 °F) will begin to cause scarring, and above 55 °C (131 °F) will cause extreme changes in the sclera and surrounding tissue. Such long exposures even in industrial settings are virtually nonexistent. [9]Chemical injury [ edit]The sclera is highly resistant to injury from brief exposure to toxic chemicals. The reflexive production of tears at the onset of chemical exposure tends to quickly wash away such irritants, preventing further harm. Acids with a p H below 2.5 are the source of greatest acidic burn risk, with sulfuric acid, the kind present in car batteries and therefore commonly available, being among the most dangerous in this regard. However, acid burns, even severe ones, seldom result in loss of the eye. [9]Alkali burns, on the other hand, such as those resulting from exposure to ammonium hydroxide or ammonium chloride or other chemicals with a p H above 11.5, will cause cellular tissue in the sclera to saponify and should be considered medical emergencies requiring immediate treatment. [9]Clinical significance [ edit]Yellowing of the sclera is a visual symptom of jaundice. In very rare but severe cases of kidney failure and liver failure, the sclera may turn black. Notes [ edit]^ The word sclera ( / ˈ s k l ɛər ə / or / ˈ s k l ɪər ə /; both are common), plural sclerae ( / ˈ s k l ɛər i / or / ˈ s k l ɪər i /) or scleras, is from the Greek skleros, meaning hard.
